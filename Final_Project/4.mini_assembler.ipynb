    "**Step 2:** Write code to find each read's *best buddy to the right* with a time-efficient algorithm. For each read **A**, find the other read **B** that has the **longest** suffix/prefix exact match with **A**. In other words, if a suffix of **A** matches a prefix of **B**, **B** is **A**'s *best buddy* to the right. **However**, if there is a tie, or if the longest suffix/prefix match is less than 40 nucleotides long, then **A** *has no best buddy to the right*.  For each read, your program should output either (a) nothing, if there is no best buddy to the right, or (b) a single, space-separated line with the IDs of **A** and **B** and the length of the overlap, like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "This indicates a 88 bp suffix of the read with ID **0255/2** that matches a prefix of the read with ID **2065/1**.  Because of how we defined best buddy, it also means no other read besides **2065/1** has a prefix of 88bp or longer that is also a suffix of read **0255/2**.  A corrolary of this is that a particular read ID should appear in the first column of your program's output at most once.  Also, since we require the overlap to be at least 40 bases long, the last column should not contain any number smaller than 40.\n",

    "* You can assume all reads are error-free and from the forward strand.  In other words, you do **not** need to consider sequencing errors or reverse complements\n",
    "* The order of the output lines is not important\n",
    "* Reading/parsing the FASTA files can be done with BioPython, or by borrowing code from <A HREF=\"https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/BenLangmead/comp-genomics-class/blob/master/notebooks/FASTA.ipynb\">this</A> if you want your own custom solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: Try to avoid comparing every read to every other read when looking for suffix/prefix matches. This can be achieved by grouping \"similar\" reads, that is reads that share common k-mers.  For instance, you can build a dictionary where the keys are k-mers and the values are sets containing the names of all reads containing that k-mer.  Since you are looking for overlaps of length at least 40, you only need to compare reads if they have at least 1 40-mer in common.\n",
